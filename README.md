# kromo
`kromo` is a play on words, combining "chromatic aberration" and "lo-mo photography". I made `kromo` because perfect optics are overrated.

## Quick Start
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

## Command line usage update
Unlike the original project, this fork does not support command line usage, it is to be used as a library, a lot of the code from command usage part relies heavily on pillow, this project avoids using that library. Though you can clone and add it yourself, with the original repo. 


## Runtime
`kromo` is slow, just like how film photography used to be. Clone the repo for a blast from the past.

The time complexity is O(n), so a 12MP picture takes 4 times longer than a 3MP picture.
